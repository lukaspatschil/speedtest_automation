# speedtest_automation

A small script to test download speed of my internet to see if i ever get the amount we pay for

## Setup

Make a folder named `out` on the same level as the script.

## How it works

It makes 10 tests for the speed of your downloads.
It writes all the entrys to a file with the date as the name.
